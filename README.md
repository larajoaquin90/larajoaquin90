- Hi! Im Joaquin! Just a lover of web development and cool designs! ðŸ¤© I love to work with the ussual web development tools and also with Figma, a web page where I can make my designs and plan how im gonna build the project and how its gonna look at the end of the day!

- My programming skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue, and Git. These skills allow me to have a comprehensive understanding of creating web pages and applications designed for and with the user. Wit this type of thinking, I can create a web that can satisfy all the need of the different user that the web can have.
